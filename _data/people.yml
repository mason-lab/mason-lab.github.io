  bio: "I am interested in the genetic underpinnings of phenotypes (especially color) in birds. I am particularly interested in integrating genetic data with biochemical, ecological, morphological, and spatial data to get a much better understanding of the mechanisms of variation. I am also interested in the phylogeny, biogeography, and natural history of birds, particularly birds from the Old World."

  bio: "I'm a northerner from Ontario, Canada and I study what shapes species distributions, mainly in birds. I have a particular interest in improving our understanding of drivers of range dynamics in migratory species. My dissertation tested hypotheses for the evolution of migration in passerine birds by contrasting different types of migrants across the Tyrannus (Kingbird) genus using museum specimens. I also did field work throughout northern South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana) to compare the fats consumed (i.e., fatty acid profiles) of migratory versus sedentary populations of Fork-tailed Flycatchers (T. savana). My recent research includes building seasonal species distribution models using citizen science datasets, improving our ability to identify umbrella taxa using Bayesian belief networks, and improving our understanding of what shapes species ranges using Bayesian belief networks (MacPherson and Logan In Prep). My ultimate research goal is to contribute to research that improves our ability to protect wildlife across rapidly changing landscapes by testing the relative roles of ecological and evolutionary processes that contribute to patterns in geographic range limits."

  bio: "David is a graduate of the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Sciences in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. He has worked for several non profits along the lower Colorado River conducting research on riparian breeders and the ecology of Elf Owls. During this time he also conducted independent research on avian migration along the Colorado River. Davidâ€™s research interests included how avian migration relates to biogeography, systematics, and the impacts of climate change on these systems."
