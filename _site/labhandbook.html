<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>The Mason Lab is dedicated to providing a safe, hospitable, and productive environment for everyone participating in Mason Lab activities regardless of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, or any other protected status. We acknowledge that effective communication requires that we treat each other with respect and courtesy in face-to-face, written, and electronic interactions and that we respect the intellectual property of our colleagues.</p>

<p>Participants in Mason Lab activities should be able to engage in open discussions free of discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Harassment will not be tolerated in any form. Harassment includes offensive gestures or verbal comments related to ethnicity, religion, disability, physical appearance, gender, or sexual orientation in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Any breaches of the code of conduct can be reported to <a href="mailto:mason@lsu.edu">Nicholas Mason</a> or the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/ombuds/">LSU Office of the Ombudsperson</a>. All reports are confidential.</p>

<h2 id="expectations-of-the-pi">Expectations of the PI</h2>

<p>As your advisor, it is my responsibility to help you be as successful as possible toward <strong>your</strong> goals—not mine. A successful mentor-mentee relationship is an ongoing collaboration that benefits from clear expectations. Here, I outline what I view as my responsibilities to help ensure your success in our lab group.</p>

<p><a name="piprojdev"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Project Development</em>: I will help you develop your research projects. I will discuss your interests and provide my perspective on how they fit into existing and ongoing research in ornithology, jointly read relevant papers, assess potential methods and study systems, and initiate contact with potential collaborators or stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pi1on1"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>1-on-1 Meetings</em>: I will prepare for our weekly or biweekly meetings. If you send me items ahead of time, I will prep for those specifically. I will often have items I would like to bring up related to research projects, professional development, lab logistics, or something else. I will try to notify you of these items before our meeting, but this may not always happen if time is tight.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pifeedback"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Reciprocal Feedback</em>: I will ask for your candid feedback about the lab, your graduate experience, and your perception of me as a mentor. I will also offer candid feedback on your progress toward your goals. I want you to succeed and am here to support you in every way possible. These conversations can sometimes be difficult, but are also important and can be extremely constructive if done properly.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pi1on1"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Writing Revisions</em>: I will help you draft, edit, and revise your writing, including grant submissions, manuscripts, and other written works. I will do my best to return edits and comments on revisions within a week (often less), with an understanding that this may not always be possible given my other obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pipresentations"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Talks and Posters</em>: I will help you prepare and rehearse presentations for conferences, job talks, or other venues. This is most effective with time to digest and incorporate feedback, so I request that practice talks occur at least one week prior to departure for the event.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pinetworking"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Networking</em>: I will write emails to introduce you to people in the field and I will connect you to people at meetings. I will also guide you in knowing what to expect from these interactions (having an ‘elevator speech’, asking them questions..). These things are more important than you think in getting a position after your degree.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="lor"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Letters of Recommendation</em>: I will write Letters of Recommendation for any opportunity you decide to apply for. If you have never asked me for a letter of recommendation, please give me at least two weeks notice before the deadline to write said letter. If I have already submitted a letter of recommendation on your behalf, I still need at least one week (better two weeks) advance notice, so that I can cater the letter to the application at hand.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="gradexpec"></a></p>
<h2 id="expectations-of-graduate-students">Expectations of Graduate Students</h2>

<p>Many of the expectations outlined here are relevant to all members, regardless of what career stage they are in or what role they play in the lab. I expect that all members are engaged, supportive, and proactive in their respective roles. That said, some expectations do differ among career stages and are outlined below.</p>

<p><a name="gradhealth"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Monitor Your Health</em>: Graduate school is a marathon, and you must monitor your own physical and mental health. Much of grad school is sedentary—infront of the computer or reading. I encourage you to be physically active when possible. Also, if you are feeling sick or unwell at all, please be cautious: stay home, rest, and recover. Also, mental health in academia is a serious issue and burnout is real. I am available to talk and appreciate knowing if you are unwell (mentally or physically), but it is also important to set and respect boundaries. If you have serious health concerns, you should consult health care professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://lsu.edu/shc/">LSU Student Health Center</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="gradteam"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Working Hours</em>: One benefit of academia is that we have flexible working hours that we can adjust to accomodate personal circadian rhythms and external responsibilities. That said, I expect that lab members will typically be available and on campus on working days (Monday through Friday, except national and university holidays) between 10:00 AM CST and 2:00 PM CST. Workloads can vary substantially from one week to the next depending on what stage a project is in or impending deadlines. There may be times when you may have to work evenings or on the weekend, but I also encourage you to take time off and to seek work-life balance. You may receive emails from me or see updates from me outside of normal working hours, but you are not expected to respond those actions outside of your normal working hours. If you are planning an extended absence for vacation or work-related travel, please check in with me first to make sure there are no conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="gradteam"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Be a Team Player</em>: Participate in lab meetings, provide feedback on practice presentations, and help proof-read or provide feedback on projects and manuscripts. Participate in group fieldwork opportunities when they arise. Put real effort into these situations. Be on time, prepare for group discussions, and provide honest and helpful feedback in a constructive manner. Respond to emails and any other correspondence in a timely fashion (ideally within one working day, even if only to acknowledge receipt of the email).</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="gradprospective"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Prospective Students</em>: I will periodically ask if prospective students, postdocs, or other lab members can contact you to ask you about your experience in the Mason Lab and at LSU. I expect you to make yourself available in these instances and to speak openly and honestly about your experience.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="gradadvice"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Seek Advice</em>: I expect you to seek my advice on issues related to your professional and academic development (e.g., TAships, research directions, funding opportunities, conferences) and to seriously consider that advice. You should also consult your peers and near-peers. That said, exercise your own judgement in applying that advice to your personal situation. Ultimately, it’s your graduate education and you are the driver.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="gradread"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Read Widely</em>: Graduate students (especially first-year students) have lots of literature to quickly become familiar with. The only way to do this is to read widely and deeply. As a lab group, we often try to keep up with the literature collectively, but it is your responsibility to make time to read primary literature, review articles, and textbooks to fill gaps in your knowledge and generate new ideas. Reading is fun!</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="grad1on1"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>1-on-1 Meetings</em>: Prepare for our regular 1-on-1 meetings so that we can make the most of our limited time together. Complete follow-up items from prior meetings and if possible, send an agenda or list of meeting items in advance of the weekly meeting or come with one prepared.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="grad1on1"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Manage Your Advisor</em>: You’re busy and your advisor is busy. Be proactive in managing your advisor: send reminders of deadlines and prior obligations, resend emails if no reply is received, take the initiative in managing the relationship.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="gradmentor"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Be a Mentor</em>: As you progress as a grad student, you will gain knowledge and skills that enable you to act as a mentor. I expect that you will seek opportunities to mentor undergraduate and possible younger graduate students in collaborative research projects.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pdexpec"></a></p>
<h2 id="expectations-of-postdoctoral-researchers">Expectations of Postdoctoral Researchers</h2>

<p>Most of the above text about Graduate Students is also relevant to postdoctoral researchers—but there are differences. Notably, each postdoctoral position is different and is dependent on the funding source. Some postdoctoral fellowships are more independent than others and will be less hands on. Other postdoctoral positions are closely tied to specific projects and will be managed more closely. Postdoctoral positions are often short and time management is crucial to success. Some additional thoughts here:</p>

<p><a name="postdocexistingprojects"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Finish Existing Projects</em>: All postdocs will arrive with existing projects that they are trying to finish. I encourage you to finish their existing work—your professional advancement and development is the overarching goal in joining my lab as a postdoc. However, your primary focus should be on current research in the Mason Lab and you should balance your time management as such.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="postdocresearchfocus"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Focus on Research and Writing</em>: Postdoctoral researchers are expected to be narrowly focused on research. I may hire postdocs to finish data analysis and writing for projects that use data collected by others rather than design projects and collect data themselves. While teaching, outreach, and service opportunities are also important, postdoctoral researchers should protect their time and recognize that their priority should be to generate lead-author publications toward being a competitive job applicant.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="postdocmentor"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Mentor Other Lab Members</em>: As a senior member of the lab group, I expect you to help in mentoring other members that are earlier in their career. Mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in the lab are good opportunities to develop and demonstrate your mentorship abilities.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="postdocjobmarket"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Navigate the Job Market</em>: Postdoctoral researchers must simultaneously finish existing projects, start and complete new projects, and look ahead to their next position, all simultaneously. This is a difficult juggling act, but is the reality of academia. I will pass along opportunities as I discover them and am available to talk about your career. Ultimately, you are responsible for finding your own way through the job market and should be proactive in seeking jobs and other postdoctoral opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lab-meetings">Lab Meetings</h2>

<p>Mason Lab meetings are currently Wednesdays 3:00 – 4:30 pm CST. Lab Meetings are our time to get together and work toward common goals. We typically rotate from member to member taking the lead on what we will focus on that week, with input from other lab members and the PI. Activities can include reading especially challenging or dense papers together, editing and revising manuscripts or grant proposals, discussing ethics in the field, practice talks or seminars, mini workshops on technical skills or new programs, presentations of new data, or something else!</p>

<h2 id="seminars">Seminars</h2>

<p>Members of the Mason Lab are expected to attend departmental seminars. You should plan to attend the SEE seminar on Monday and the LSUMNS museum seminar on Friday each week at a minimum, even if the topic is outside of the immediate interests. Seminars are a fantastic way to quickly gain expertise in a specific area and to get to know the people and institutions that drive research.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lsu.edu/mns/education/museumseminar.php">LSUMNS Museum Seminar Series</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.lsu.edu/science/biosci/seminar.php">LSU BioSci Seminar Calendar</a></p>

<h2 id="journal-clubs-and-reading-groups">Journal Clubs and Reading Groups</h2>

<p>Journal clubs, reading group, and semester-long seminars are fantastic ways to cover the literature. Dissecting papers as a group often leads to deeper, more nuanced understanding of the work at hand. I encourage lab members to attend these opportunities as it fits their schedule and to establish new reading groups if they find one that doesn’t meet their current needs or interests.</p>

<h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2>

<p>I expect that you will attend and present at academic conferences, an average of perhaps one per year, maybe more when you are on the job market. Conferences are an important venue to present your own work and to network with other people in our fields. If you have something to present (i.e., a poster or a talk), I will try to provide funding to attend via lab funds, but probably cannot afford to finance more than one conference per person per year. You should also apply for all sources of funding, both internally and for specific conferences, and should try to keep conference costs down. The lab will likely not cover costs if you are not presenting research. Personally, I try to attend the <a href="https://americanornithology.org/">American Ornithological Society</a> and the <a href="https://www.evolutionsociety.org/">Society for the Study of Evolution</a> each year. Those will likely be quite relevant to you as well, but you are not limited to those conferences and are encouraged to attend whichever conference you think you will benefit most from.</p>

<h2 id="service">Service</h2>

<p>Many aspects of academia rely on volunteer service to function. Serving on committees, acting as a peer reviewer, organizing seminars are all done on a volunteer basis. I expect that members of my lab will contribute their time and effort to service in some way, but you should monitor your time and energy and recognize your priorities. Service can be very rewarding, but can also become overwhelming—protect your boundaries and learn when to say ‘no’.</p>

<h4 id="service-to-the-university">Service to the University</h4>

<p>You may be asked to serve on departmental or university committees. If there is a pressing issue, you can also form committees to take action toward improving some aspect of academia. This allows you to have a voice in departmental issues and</p>

<h4 id="service-to-the-field">Service to the Field</h4>

<p>There are numerous opportunities to help academic societies in their mission through volunteer efforts and service to fields within biology. I encourage my lab members to participate in these opportunities and may suggest opportunities to you. Again, it is ultimately your decision to participate or not, but I believe service is important for professional development and also giving back to our communities.</p>

<h4 id="service-to-the-community">Service to the Community</h4>

<p>We occasionally (and hopefully increasingly) have opportunities to interact with with community scientists through outreach and public education opportunities. For example, each month we have the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/mns/news/2019/2019-2020_night-at-the-museum.php">LSUMNS Night at the Museum</a>. There may be other opportunities to interact with K–12 classrooms or contribute to other outreach initiatives. These are important activities to promote the next generation of scientists and cultivate interest and stewardship of our natural world. I encourage you to participate as your commitments allow.</p>

<h2 id="curatorial-work">Curatorial Work</h2>

<p>It is expected that each Mason Lab member will continue to the maintenance and growth of the bird collection at the LSUMNS. Each graduate student will spend at least one year as a curatorial assistant, where they will work with PI Mason and the collections managers on a variety of tasks, including specimen preparation, accessioning new specimens, processing loans, collections upkeep, and more.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more guidelines and policy on working in the collections.</p>

<h2 id="lab-work">Lab Work</h2>

<p>Many members of the Mason Lab will incorporate molecular work into their research projects. The Mason Lab is part of a shared molecular lab that is a collaborative effort among the various curators in the LSUMNS. You are responsible for making sure that our shared lab space is clean and organized and abide by rules and regulations set up by the lab manager, Dr. Janet Buckner.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more guidelines and policy on working in wet lab.</p>

<h2 id="reproducible-research">Reproducible Research</h2>

<p>Reproducibility is an essential component of successful research. We are supportive of producing openly available, reproducible workflows. Doing so benefits us by</p>

<h4 id="documenting-workflows">Documenting Workflows</h4>

<p>It is important to save scripts and record settings used to run programs in generating and analyzing data. An excellent way to do this is through GitHub. I recommend that each user get a GitHub account and create a repository for each project that they are working on. By uploading scripts and program input files, we work towards transparency and reproducibility in our research.</p>

<p>More on reproducible workflows soon.</p>

<h4 id="data-management">Data Management</h4>

<p>Back up your data. Back up your backups. Have multiple backups in different physical locations (i.e., one at work, one at home). Hard drives fail and redundancy is key to avoiding a data loss catastrophe.</p>

<p>More on data storage and archiving policies soon.</p>

<h2 id="authorship">Authorship</h2>

<p>When we start projects, we will frame out roles and authorship for projects. Over time, projects change, personnel change, etc. We will re-evaluate authorship changes when necessary throughout stages of a project. Please voice your opinion if there are any disagreements about any aspect of this process. To be an author on manuscripts out of the lab, we try our best to make sure that all authors meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Substantial contributions to conception / design of the project or  in the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data</li>
  <li>Writing the manuscript or critical revisions of the scientific content</li>
  <li>Accountability for the integrity of the research and willingness to represent all aspects of the paper</li>
  <li>Final approval of the manuscript version that will be published</li>
</ul>
