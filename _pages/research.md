#### Avian Biodiveristy

Our research group seeks to understand the ecological and evolutionary forces that underlie avian diversification, both terms of speciation as well as phenotypic evolution. We use an eclectic and expanding toolbox to understand avian diversification. Within this broader framework, research in the Mason Lab has focused on a variety of systems and questions, such as vocalizations in tanagers and camouflage in larks.

#### Human Impacts on Birds

The planet is rapidly changing with dramatic impacts for wildlife and biodiveristy. Natural history collections provide the 'ultimate long-term dataset' to study how birds are responding to anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture and deforestation.
