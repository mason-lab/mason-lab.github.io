The Mason Lab studies avian ecology, evolution, and conservation at the [Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science](http://https://www.lsu.edu/mns/) and the [Louisiana State University Department of Biological Science](https://www.lsu.edu/science/biosci/). 

Our overarching goal is to study and document avian biodiversity. Natural history collections are critical to all aspects of our research and we are dedicated to their growth and welfare. We are also promote stewardship of our planet through education and outreach.
