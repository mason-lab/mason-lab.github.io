The Mason Lab studies avian evolution, ecology, and conservation at the [Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science](http://https://www.lsu.edu/mns/) and the [Louisiana State University Department of Biological Science](https://www.lsu.edu/science/biosci/) since Fall 2020. 

We are museum-based ornithologists. Our overarching goal is to study and document avian biodiversity, and natural history collections are central to that mission. We further promote the stewardship of our planet through education and outreach to increase ecological and evolutionary literacy and mitigate biodiversity loss.
