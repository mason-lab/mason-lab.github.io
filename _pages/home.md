The Mason Lab studies avian ecology, evolution, and conservation at the [Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science](http://https://www.lsu.edu/mns/) and the [Louisiana State University Department of Biological Science](https://www.lsu.edu/science/biosci/). 

We are museum-based ornithologists. Our overarching goal is to study and document avian biodiversity, and natural history collections are central to that mission. We also promote stewardship of our planet through education and outreach to promote biological literacy and mitigate biodiversity loss.
