### Postdoctoral Researchers

I am always eager to sponsor postdoctoral researchers that share research interests with our lab group. There are various routes to pursuing a postdoc in my lab at LSU: (1) Postdoctoral positions be associated with specific projects will be periodically available and will be advertised here and elsewhere. I am also interested in collaborating with potential postdoc applicants to submit full NSF grants that include financial support for postdoctoral positions. (2) Postdoctoral Fellowships, such as the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622">NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology</a>, or the <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp">NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship</a> provide opportunities to join our lab group. I would be happy to work with interested applicants to sponsor and craft their applications.

### Ph.D. Students

I typically recruit 1â€“2 PhD students per year. If you are thinking about applying, I suggest you look through our web page and read some of the papers we have published. Then, please send me an e-mail describing your research interests and why you would like to join our research group. Please also include a resume or CV with GPA and GRE scores. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/prospectivestudentemails.html">Some advice on crafting an initial email to potential labs can be found here.</a> More on lab policies and my mentoring philosophy can be found here. 

### M.Sc. Students

I am not currently accepting M.Sc. students, but this will likely change in the future once my lab group is more established. 

### Undergraduate Students

I am always looking for undergraduate students with an interest in museum-based ornithology.
