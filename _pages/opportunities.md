### Postdoctoral Researchers

I am always eager to sponsor postdoctoral researchers that share research interests with our lab group. There are various routes to a postdoc in my lab at LSU: (1) Postdoctoral positions be associated with specific projects will be periodically available and will be advertised here and elsewhere. I am also interested in collaborating with potential postdoc applicants to submit full NSF grants that include financial support for postdoctoral positions. (2) Postdoctoral Fellowships, such as the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622">NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology</a>, or the <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp">NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship</a> provide opportunities to join our lab group. I would be happy to work with interested applicants to sponsor and craft their applications.

### Ph.D. Students

I usually hope to recruit 1â€“2 PhD students per year. I encourage students to pursue their own research interests and projects that fall within the conceptual framework of our lab, which you can learn more about on our <a href="https://mason-lab.org/research">research page</a>. More information on my mentoring policy and lab guidelines can be found <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/labpolicy.html">here</a>. If you are interested in applying, I suggest you look through our web page and read some of the papers we have published. Then, please send an <a href="mailto:mason@lsu.edu">e-mail to PI Nick Mason</a> with a brief description of your experience, research interests, and why you would like to join our  group. Please also include a resume or CV, GPA, and any examples of scientific writing that you can offer.

### M.Sc. Students

I am unlikely to take M.Sc. students in my first few years as a PI, but will be interested in mentoring M.Sc. students later on and will update this space accordingly. 

### Undergraduate Students

I am always looking for undergraduate students with an interest in museum-based ornithology. Please send an <a href="mailto:mason@lsu.edu">e-mail to PI Nick Mason</a> to inquire about opportunities.
