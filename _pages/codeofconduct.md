#Mason Lab Code of Conduct

<a href="https://www.lsu.edu/saa/students/codeofconduct.php">LSU Student Code of Conduct</a>

<a href="https://www.lsu.edu/policies/">LSU University Policies</a>

The Mason Lab is dedicated to providing a safe, hospitable, and productive environment for everyone participating in Mason Lab activities regardless of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, or any other protected status. We acknowledge that effective communication requires that we treat each other with respect and courtesy in face-to-face, written, and electronic interactions and that we respect the intellectual property of our colleagues.

Participants in Mason Lab activities should be able to engage in open discussions free of discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Harassment will not be tolerated in any form. Harassment includes offensive gestures or verbal comments related to ethnicity, religion, disability, physical appearance, gender, or sexual orientation in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Any breaches of the code of conduct can be reported to <a href="mailto:mason@lsu.edu">Nicholas Mason</a> or the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/ombuds/">LSU Office of the Ombudsperson</a>. All reports are confidential.
